P0002,Measurement of tritium concentration in heavy water by azeotropic distillation,Radiation Physics and Engineering,2023,"In this work, the concentration of tritium in D۲O of various degrees of purity was measured. Samples were taken from the Arak heavy water plant and tritium concentrations were determined using a liquid scintillation detector (LSC) based on tritium decay. In this work, instead of simple distillation, is used the azeotropic distillation method. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-۲۱۰۰ spectrometer and an LS۵۰B fluorescence spectrometer. The tritium concentration in the samples varied from ۱.۷۵ ± ۰.۸۰ to ۶.۱۶ ± ۱.۰۱ Bq.L-۱ in D۲O enrichment from ۰.۳۵% to ۷۷.۵۰%. The correlation coefficient between tritium concentration and D۲O purity in heavy water was obtained as R۲ = ۰.۸۵۳. Deviation for ۹۹.۸% D۲O enriched in heavy water.

Due to the disadvantages of segmented projectiles with, the simulation of segmented projectile with is discussed. Projectiles with aspect ratio greater than one are known as short-rod projectiles. This aspect ratio range forms both the primary and secondary phase of penetration. Numerical simulation was performed by AUTODYN software with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) method. The use of SPH approach is most consistent with the experimental results. In order to have effective segmented projectiles, greater speeds were used in the simulations. In this range of velocity, due to the hydrodynamic penetration and complete erosion of the rods, the maximum penetration depth is obtained. After a relatively good correlation between the simulation results and the experimental and Hydrocode results, the numerical analysis of the segmented projectiles is performed. The results show an increase in the penetration depth of segmented projectile relative to the continuous type. In the following, the relationship between velocity increase and penetration depth and crater diameter of this type of projectile is investigated.
